### Ragdoll Operators

Any change made interactively is made via a so-called "Operator".

Operators are Blender's way of encapsulating an action with undo/redo, along with modal edits such as activating a picker and picking a mesh to replace a collider with.

In this directory, you'll find all of the operators implemented for Ragdoll, to manipulate both the Ragdoll and Blender scenes such as assigning markers and recording your simulation onto keyframes.
